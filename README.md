# Kubie
`kubie` is an alternative to `kubectx`, `kubens` and `k on`. It offers context switching, namespace switching and
prompt modification in an isolated fashion.

## Primer
The main design goal of kubie is to isolate kubernetes environments from each other. Kubie will never modify your k8s
config files. Before spawning a shell in a new context, it will create a temporary config file which contains the
context you wish to use. The namespace changes are made in that temporary config file, leaving your original config
files untouched. This is how Kubie achieves isolation.

Kubie also supports recursive contexts. The depth of the context recursion if displayed in the shell prompt, the third
component of the prompt: `[context|namespace|depth]` for instance `[dev|services|3]`.

Kubie also has other nice features such as `kubie exec` which allows you to execute commands in a context and a
namespace without having to spawn a shell. There's also `kubie lint` which scans your k8s config files for issues
and informs you of what they are.

## Installation
First, clone the repo.

If you have `rust` and `cargo` on your machine, you can use `cargo install --path .` to build the project and install
it in `~/.cargo/bin`. Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH variable.

If you don't have Rust installed you can simply copy one of the pre-built binaries available in the releases folder to
one of the directories in your PATH variable. For instance you can do `sudo cp releases/linux/amd64/v0.3.0/kubie /usr/local/bin`
from the git repo.

You may also create a bash alias such as `alias kubectx='kubie ctx'` and `alias kubens='kubie ns'` since old habits die
hard.

### Bash autocomplete
If you want autocompletion for `kubie ctx`, `kubie ns` and `kubie exec`, please install this script:
```
sudo cp ./completion/kubie.bash $(pkg-config --variable=completionsdir bash-completion)/kubie.bash
```

## Usage
Note that if you have [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) installed, the experience will be greatly improved.
Selectable menus will be available when using `kubie ctx` and `kubie ns`.

---

* `kubie ctx` show the list of available contexts (if fzf is installed, display a selectable menu of contexts)
* `kubie ctx <context>` switch the current shell to the given context (spawns a shell if not a kubie shell)
* `kubie ctx <context> -r` spawn a recursive shell in the given context
* `kubie ctx <context> -n <namespace>` spawn a shell in the given context and namespace
* `kubie ns` show the list of available namespaces (if fzf is installed, display a selectable menu of namespaces)
* `kubie ns <namespace>` switch the current shell to the given namespace
* `kubie ns <namespace> -r` spawn a recursive shell in the given namespace
* `kubie exec <context> <namespace> <cmd> <args>...` execute a command in the given context and namespace
* `kubie exec <wildcard> <namespace> <cmd> <args>...` execute a command in all the contexts matched by the wildcard and
  in the given namespace
* `kubie exec <wildcard> <namespace> -e <cmd> <args>...` execute a command in all the contexts matched by the wildcard and
  in the given namespace but fail early if any of the commands executed return a non-zero exit code
* `kubie lint` lint k8s config files for issues
* `kubie info ctx` print name of current context
* `kubie info ns` print name of current namespace
* `kubie info depth` print depth of recursive contexts

## Settings
You can customize kubie's behavior with the `~/.kube/kubie.yaml` file. The settings available and their defaults are
available below.

```yaml
configs: # configure where to lookup the kubernetes configs
    include: # include these globs
        - ~/.kube/config
        - ~/.kube/*.yml
        - ~/.kube/*.yaml
        - ~/.kube/configs/*.yml
        - ~/.kube/configs/*.yaml
        - ~/.kube/kubie/*.yml
        - ~/.kube/kubie/*.yaml
    exclude: # exclude these globs
        - ~/.kube/kubie.yaml
prompt: # prompt settings
    show_depth: true # show depth
```

## Future plans
* Integration with vault to automatically download k8s configs from a vault server
* Import/edit configs
